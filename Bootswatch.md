This contains lots of template for bootstraps. These are themes for bootstrap.
For this project i will be using **Lux**.

## Process to use these themes.
- Download the `bootstrap.min.css` file and put it inside `src` folder and import in `index.js`.
- Also install React Bootstrap to use the Bootstrap.
> Adding `bootstrap.min.css` will only provide theme.

### Few themes that i liked are
- Lux
- Litera
- Minty
- Pulse
- Sketchy
