Redux-Toolkit already comes with thunk loaded with.

in redux toolkit we have to create a slice and mention that slice in the store as shown below.

```js
import { configureStore } from '@reduxjs/toolkit'
import productSlice from './productSlice';

const store = configureStore({
  reducer: {
    product: productSlice,
  },
})

export default store;
```

In the slice we have to create actions over there.

I am making an `async` call that's why i have to create actions separately , or else i could have created action inside reducers itself.
In the below shown example `reducers` option is empty for now.

For async call, we are using `createAsyncThunk` API, which will make async request and in slice we have to mention it inside `extraReducers` in which we get builder, so we will check all the states of that async call and do something. Here is the implementation that i did


```js

import { createSlice, createAsyncThunk } from '@reduxjs/toolkit'
import axios from 'axios'

const initialState = {
  loading: false,
  products: [],
  error: null
}
export const listProducts = createAsyncThunk(
  'product/listProducts',
  async () => {
    const { data } = await axios.get('/api/products')
    return data
  }
)

export const productSlice = createSlice({
  name: 'product',
  initialState,
  reducers: {},
  extraReducers: (builder) => {
    builder.addCase(listProducts.pending, (state) => {
      state.loading = true
    })
    builder.addCase(listProducts.fulfilled, (state, action) => {
      state.loading = false
      state.products = action.payload
    })
    builder.addCase(listProducts.rejected, (state, action) => {
      state.loading = false
      state.error = action.error.message
    })
  }
})



export default productSlice.reducer

```
