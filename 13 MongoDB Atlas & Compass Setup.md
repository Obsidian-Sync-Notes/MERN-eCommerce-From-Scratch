#backend 

Go to https://mongodb.com and login with your account.

You have to build a cluster.


Download MongoDB compass and install.

In Atlas, go to Security and create a new database user.

In Network access we have to add IP address over there, for now we will allow access it from anywhere.

Then go back to clusters and click on collections and add some data, it will ask a database name and collection name.

Go to clusters view, click connect and copy the URI and put that in dotenv file.
